					<h1>Dungeoneer</h1>
					<p>Dungeoneer was the the second game I ever coded. One year prior to building it I had taken a computer engineering class where we learned a very basic programing language called turing. It was really old but it was also easy to learn. In the next year I had a morning co-op at an electronics store where I began working on a game in turing that to this day I haven't bothered to name. Long story short it was a foundation for Dungeoneer but I eventually scrapped it. By the end of the year I had completed dungeoneer (or got to a point where I was satisfied and gave up) and set it aside for a while. I consider it the first actual game I ever programed and it inspired me to pursue game design as a career.</p>

					<h1>Snake1 (an ASCII game)</h1>
					<p>Snake1 was a proof of concept game I made on my free time during my computer science class. I became super interested an ASCII game which are basically games that use typing characters as there graphics. I really liked how it looked and using graphics in java seemed a little daunting to learn. I tried to recreate the classic "snake" game as an ASCII game which in the end turned out pretty well or at least it would have if I had bothered to finish it. I got everything done but I just never bothered to make it so you could die. like I said it was just a proof of concept.</p>

					<h1>ASCII Animations</h1>
					<p>After building snake1 I thought I might try some more complex ASCII stuff so I took some of my favorite gifs and memes and made them into ASCII animations. to be honest it wasn't that hard but it took a while.</p>

					<h1>Sand.jar</h1>
					<p>This was the first Functional java graphics program I ever built. This is based on a program I saw while playing Super-Hot. It starts by randomly generating a few static blocks for the sand to move around and then continuously drops sand into the area. I think it turned out ok; my only issue is that the sand has a preference to fall to the left. I could have coded that out but I didn't feel like it.</p>
