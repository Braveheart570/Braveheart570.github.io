					<h1>Dungeoneer</h1>
					<p>Dungeoneer was the the second game I ever coded. one year prior to building it I had taken a computer engineering class where we learned a very basic programing language called turing. it was really old but it was also easy to learn. in the next year I had a morning co-op at an electronics store where I began working on a game in turing that to this day I haven't bothered to name. long story short it was a foundation for Dungeoneer but I eventually scrapped it. by the end of the year I had completed dungeoneer (or got to a point where I was satisfied and gave up) and set it aside for a while. I consider it the first actual game I ever programed and it inspired me to pursue game design as a career.</p>

					<h1>snake1 (an ASCII game)</h1>
					<p>snake1 was a proof of concept game I made on my free time during my computer science class. I became super interested an ASCII game which are basically games that use typing characters as there graphics. I really liked how it looked and using graphics in java seemed a little daunting to learn. I tried to recreate the classic "snake" game as an ASCII game which in the end turned out pretty well or at least it would have if I had bothered to finish it. I got everything done but I just never bothered to make it so you could die. like I said it was just a proof of concept.</p>

					<h1>ASCII animations</h1>
					<p>after building snake1 I thought I might try some more complex ASCII stuff so I took some of my favorite gifs and memes and made them into ASCII animations. to be honest it wasn't that hard but it took a while.</p>
